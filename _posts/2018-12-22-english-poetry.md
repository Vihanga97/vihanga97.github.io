## The Daughter of Stardust

I was born within these walls.<br>
I carry them around, wherever I wander;<br>
The glass keeps me safe from<br>
Their blades and arrows and bombs<br>
As I trudge my way through, with caution.<br>
I hear them whispering<br>
About my hair, my mouth, my skin;<br>
Never the right size, never the right colour.<br>
I draw my glass walls closer,<br>
Hoping that would somehow shield me<br>
Against their ruthless eyes.<br>
The whispers get louder;<br>
My breasts, my thighs, my hips.<br>
My brain, my heart, my voice.<br>
Do I deserve, to be thus<br>
Sliced and diced and assessed<br>
Under their relentless scrutiny?<br>
As I bow my head in defeat,<br>
The ghosts of my ancestors<br>
Spring up around me.<br>
I gaze at them, with tenderness,<br>
And slowly, I see<br>
Stars and planets and galaxies<br>
Where their flaws and imperfections used to be.<br>
My eyes revert to my body.<br>
Was it not wonderful all along?<br>
As the glass walls shatter, I scream<br>
At the top of my lungs, fearless and dauntless;<br>
"I am the daughter of stardust;<br>
And majestic is all that I shall ever be."

## An Ode to My Love

'Twas the days of chagrin and turmoil,<br>
The world falling apart beneath our feet;<br>
Yet, amidst the chaos of perpetual desolation,<br>
I sensed a whiff of home.<br>

The world seemed hazy beneath the dust of all things broken,<br>
But the beacon that called my name remained undulled;<br>
My steps were slow, but never unsteady;<br>
The world was falling apart, but we were falling together.<br>

As the dust settled down and specs of green kissed the burnt up ground,<br>
Writ in our hearts was a vow of eternal affection;<br>
"Be the world as it may, with all its bliss and despair;<br>
For you, my love, my heart shall forever shine sanguine."

## The Little Rascal

He was not a pretty child.<br>
His greasy curls constantly invaded<br>
The large, sombre eyes<br>
That never cared for civilities.<br>
"That snotty little rascal," they used to call him;<br>
At eight, he was already a master of trickery.<br>
The streets were his home,<br>
His academy, and his sanctuary;<br>
Or so he used to think, but then<br>
He met her. The bent old woman<br>
Selling achcharu by the school street.<br>
She never seemed to notice<br>
How he snatched a handful of<br>
Spiced mangoes or pickled veralu<br>
Off her laden basket, when she wasn't looking.<br>
Neither did he notice<br>
How the occasional scoop of achcharu she offered<br>
Turned into packets of rice, then old clothes,<br>
Then one day, an invitation to her home.

She still sells achcharu<br>
By that very same street;<br>
Alone in the morning,<br>
But a little companion<br>
Clad in a white shirt and faded blue shorts<br>
Joins her every evening.

## Kill Me with Love

Lead me to the horizon where hell meets heaven,<br>
To the paradise isle of fanciful romantics<br>
Where honeysuckles blossom and wither in plenty;<br>
Drown me in ephemeral oaths and contrived caresses<br>
Till my gossamer wings dissolve in the morning dew.<br>
When the delusion dwindles<br>
And the remnants of our tainted glass sculptures pierce my heart,<br>
Lay strings of forget-me-nots around my gravestone,<br>
And kiss the daisies by my oasis ever so softly.

## My Island Bride

The aroma of black coffee on a lazy rainy morn<br>
Wrapped in blankets; jasmines on her tangled braids<br>
As she leans down, leaving a shy kiss on my brow<br>
Fixing the crumpled pleats on her maroon-gold saree.<br>
Her energetic chatter rises with the sun;<br>
"What do you love more; me or my dosai?"<br>
She laughs, threatening to poke me with<br>
Fingertips ladden with red henna and green coconut chutney.<br>
Eves at the kovil, sindoor on her golden brow,<br>
Marigolds in hues as vibrant as her blessed soul;<br>
Exotic chants and bells and fumes of incense<br>
To bring out the goddess in my woman.

The sun rises still over the hills of her isle,<br>
Though it holds not for me the joys of my youth<br>
But the beloved agony of reminiscence;<br>
Oh, how I miss my island bride.

## To Kill My Killer

On a forgotten alley in my hometown<br>
Scattered with abandoned dreams of the forlorn,<br>
I caught a glimpse of a familiar figure<br>
That I once dreaded and despiced with all my might.<br>
Its eyes, that once raged hot with fire,<br>
Have burnt out, leaving behind ashes and charcoal<br>
And a fading trail of smoke.<br>
Those beastly arms that locked around my body<br>
In an inescapable grasp, when I was a weakling,<br>
Have wasted away into papery skin<br>
Wrapped around its misshapen skeleton.<br>
In its feeble state, knowing it could own me no more,<br>
Its disdainful glare turned fearful, then apologetic;<br>
Staring right into its demonic eyes,<br>
I snapped its loathsome neck in two.<br>
As I walked away from its carcass,<br>
I could feel, stronger than ever,<br>
The rage in my eyes and the strength in my arms<br>
And the sheer power vested in me<br>
By the vast, unapologetic universe.

## The Land I Once Loved

Placed amidst the frolicking waves of a serene blue ocean,<br>
The land I once loved used to shine bright and proud.<br>
Adorned with lush forests and rippling creeks<br>
And a millennium's worth of brilliantly fearless humans;<br>
My land was where heaven intertwined itself<br>
With alluring earthly terrains.<br>
I surf through wave after wave of painful memories<br>
Trying to find the origin of the downfall of my paradise.<br>
Thousands of years of jubilant history<br>
Demolished by the mock decency veiling repugnant idiocy.<br>
Now I hold onto my keys and pray to all gods<br>
As I walk the same streets where<br>
My ancestors used to roam free.<br>
Everything I eat is poisoned.<br>
Everywhere I look is sabotaged.<br>
I slash my ballot sheets with ruthless lines<br>
Because how do I decide; which bastard shall I choose<br>
To rape my mother this time?<br>
I see the ignorance in my people's eyes.<br>
I feel the pain in their deterioriating bodies.<br>
Where the trees once kissed the skies<br>
Now stand towering columns spitting out toxic fumes.<br>
To lament or not to lament?<br>
The land I once loved is now barren.

## When I'm Gone

Someday, when I'm gone,<br>
Write on my tombstone,<br>
Not of my accomplishments, my mistakes and failures;<br>
But of the things I loved.<br>
Write about my dog, my friends,<br>
And the love of my life;<br>
The worn out dresses and the slowest of bike rides.<br>
Write about the days spent on hilltops and roadsides,<br>
And days spent in pj's with messy hair and rom-coms.<br>
Write about the hours geeking over a sum<br>
And the playful days laughing under the sun.<br>
Write, not in gold, but in sparkling mauve cursives,<br>
"Lies here a girl who fell in love with love."
