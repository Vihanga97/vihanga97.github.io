I carry them around, wherever I wander; The glass keeps me safe from Their blades and arrows and bombs As I trudge my way through, with caution. I hear them whispering About my hair, my mouth, my skin; Never the right size, never the right colour. I draw my glass walls closer, Hoping that would somehow shield me Against their ruthless eyes. The whispers get louder; My breasts, my thighs, my hips. My brain, my heart, my voice. Do I deserve, to be thus Sliced and diced and assessed Under their relentless scrutiny? As I bow my head in defeat, The ghosts of my ancestors Spring up around me. I gaze at them, with tenderness, And slowly, I see Stars and planets and galaxies Where their flaws and imperfections used to be. My eyes revert to my body. Was it not wonderful all along? As the glass walls shatter, I scream At the top of my lungs, fearless and dauntless; “I am the daughter of stardust; And majestic is all that I shall ever be.”</p> <hr> <h2 id="an-ode-to-my-love">An Ode to My Love</h2> <p>‘Twas the days of chagrin and turmoil, The world falling apart beneath our feet; Yet, amidst the chaos of perpetual desolation, I sensed a whiff of home.</p> <p>The world seemed hazy beneath the dust of all things broken, But the beacon that called my name remained undulled; My steps were slow, but never unsteady; The world was falling apart, but we were falling together.</p> <p>As the dust settled down and specs of green kissed the burnt up ground, Writ in our hearts was a vow of eternal affection; “Be the world as it may, with all its bliss and despair; For you, my love, my heart shall forever shine sanguine.”</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-little-rascal">The Little Rascal</h2> <p>He was not a pretty child. His greasy curls constantly invaded The large, sombre eyes That never cared for civilities. “That snotty little rascal,” they used to call him; At eight, he was already a master of trickery. The streets were his home, His academy, and his sanctuary; Or so he used to think, but then He met her. The bent old woman Selling achcharu by the school street. She never seemed to notice How he snatched a handful of Spiced mangoes or pickled veralu Off her laden basket, when she wasn’t looking. Neither did he notice How the occasional scoop of achcharu she offered Turned into packets of rice, then old clothes, Then one day, an invitation to her home.</p> <p>She still sells achcharu By that very same street; Alone in the morning, But a little companion Clad in a white shirt and faded blue shorts Joins her every evening.</p> <hr> <h2 id="kill-me-with-love">Kill Me with Love</h2> <p>Lead me to the horizon where hell meets heaven, To the paradise isle of fanciful romantics Where honeysuckles blossom and wither in plenty; Drown me in ephemeral oaths and contrived caresses Till my gossamer wings dissolve in the morning dew. When the delusion dwindles And the remnants of our tainted glass sculptures pierce my heart, Lay strings of forget-me-nots around my gravestone, And kiss the daisies by my oasis ever so softly.</p> <hr> <h2 id="my-island-bride">My Island Bride</h2> <p>The aroma of black coffee on a lazy rainy morn Wrapped in blankets; jasmines on her tangled braids As she leans down, leaving a shy kiss on my brow Fixing the crumpled pleats on her maroon-gold saree. Her energetic chatter rises with the sun; “What do you love more; me or my dosai?” She laughs, threatening to poke me with Fingertips ladden with red henna and green coconut chutney. Eves at the kovil, sindoor on her golden brow, Marigolds in hues as vibrant as her blessed soul; Exotic chants and bells and fumes of incense To bring out the goddess in my woman. The sun rises still over the hills of her isle, Though it holds not for me the joys of my youth But the beloved agony of reminiscence; Oh, how I miss my island bride.</p> <hr> <h2 id="to-kill-my-killer">To Kill My Killer</h2> <p>On a forgotten alley in my hometown Scattered with abandoned dreams of the forlorn, I caught a glimpse of a familiar figure That I once dreaded and despiced with all my might. Its eyes, that once raged hot with fire, Have burnt out, leaving behind ashes and charcoal And a fading trail of smoke. Those beastly arms that locked around my body In an inescapable grasp, when I was a weakling, Have wasted away into papery skin Wrapped around its misshapen skeleton. In its feeble state, knowing it could own me no more, Its disdainful glare turned fearful, then apologetic; Staring right into its demonic eyes, I snapped its loathsome neck in two. As I walked away from its carcass, I could feel, stronger than ever, The rage in my eyes and the strength in my arms And the sheer power vested in me By the vast, unapologetic universe.</p> <hr> <h2 id="the-land-i-once-loved">The Land I Once Loved</h2> <p>Placed amidst the frolicking waves of a serene blue ocean, The land I once loved used to shine bright and proud. Adorned with lush forests and rippling creeks And a millennium’s worth of brilliantly fearless humans; My land was where heaven intertwined itself With alluring earthly terrains. I surf through wave after wave of painful memories Trying to find the origin of the downfall of my paradise. Thousands of years of jubilant history Demolished by the mock decency veiling repugnant idiocy. Now I hold onto my keys and pray to all gods As I walk the same streets where My ancestors used to roam free. Everything I eat is poisoned. Everywhere I look is sabotaged. I slash my ballot sheets with ruthless lines Because how do I decide; which bastard shall I choose To rape my mother this time? I see the ignorance in my people’s eyes. I feel the pain in their deterioriating bodies. Where the trees once kissed the skies Now stand towering columns spitting out toxic fumes. To lament or not to lament? The land I once loved is now barren.</p> <hr> <h2 id="when-im-gone">When I’m Gone</h2> <p>Someday, when I’m gone, Write on my tombstone, Not of my accomplishments, my mistakes and failures; But of the things I loved. Write about my dog, my friends, And the love of my life; The worn out dresses and the slowest of bike rides. Write about the days spent on hilltops and roadsides, And days spent in pj’s with messy hair and rom-coms. Write about the hours geeking over a sum And the playful days laughing under the sun. Write, not in gold, but in sparkling mauve cursives, “Lies here a girl who fell in love with love.”</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/"></d-bibliography><div id="giscus_thread" style="max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto;"> <script>let giscusTheme=localStorage.getItem("theme"),giscusAttributes={src:"https://giscus.app/client.js","data-repo":"Vihanga97/vihanga97.github.io","data-repo-id":"","data-category":"Comments","data-category-id":"","data-mapping":"title","data-strict":"1","data-reactions-enabled":"1","data-emit-metadata":"0","data-input-position":"bottom","data-theme":giscusTheme,"data-lang":"en",crossorigin:"anonymous",async:""},giscusScript=document.createElement("script");Object.entries(giscusAttributes).forEach(([t,a])=>giscusScript.setAttribute(t,a)),document.getElementById("giscus_thread").appendChild(giscusScript);</script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="http://giscus.app/?ref_noscript" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">comments powered by giscus.</a> </noscript> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2023 Vihanga Dewmini Jayawickrama.
